# Quantum Task: BB84 Protocol 📑

**Instructions:** Read the questions carefully and provide detailed answers. Show all the necessary steps in your calculations and include code snippets where appropriate. You may use Qiskit and its visualization tools to implement and verify the BB84 protocol. The qubits generated by Alice should be random. Good luck!

**Question 1: Quantum Circuit for BB84**

The BB84 protocol is a quantum key distribution scheme that allows two parties, Alice and Bob, to establish a shared secret key. Create a quantum circuit using Qiskit that represents the BB84 protocol. The circuit should include all the necessary quantum gates and operations for encoding and decoding qubits in the BB84 scheme. Show the circuit diagram and provide the corresponding Qiskit code.

**Question 2: Key Generation**

In the BB84 protocol, Alice sends a series of random qubits to Bob,  For this question, generate a random qubit sequence of length n for Alice's qubits. Show the measurement results for each qubit, and identify the bits that contribute to the final shared secret key.





**Note**: Remember to show all the necessary steps, provide clear explanations, and use code comments where appropriate. Submit your answers as a well-organized document or notebook, including relevant code snippets, diagrams, and figures.
